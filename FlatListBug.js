This React Native bug involves unexpected behavior when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering logic.  The issue manifests as random crashes or freezes, particularly on lower-end devices.  The crashes aren't consistently reproducible and lack clear error messages in the console, making debugging challenging.  Performance profiling reveals significant jank and dropped frames during scrolling, suggesting inefficient rendering or memory management.
